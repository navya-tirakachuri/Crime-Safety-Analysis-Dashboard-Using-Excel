# Crime-Safety-Analysis-Dashboard-Using-Excel
This project analyzes crime and safety data using Microsoft Excel. The analysis focuses on data cleaning, organizing, and extracting meaningful insights through pivot tables, charts, and Excel formulas to understand crime patterns and safety trends.

## Project Overview
This project involves analyzing a crime safety dataset using **Microsoft Excel**. The main objective is to clean the data, perform exploratory analysis, and derive meaningful insights related to crime patterns and public safety.  
All tasks in this project are performed **only using Excel**, without any programming languages or external tools.

## Dataset Description
The dataset contains information related to crime and safety incidents. It includes various attributes such as:
1. Type of crime
2. Location / Area
3. Date and time
4. Victim age, Gender, Race

## Tools Used
1. **Microsoft Excel**
  a. Data Cleaning
  b. Sorting and Filtering
  c. Pivot Tables
  d. Charts and Graphs
  e. Excel Formulas

## Steps Performed

### 1. Data Cleaning
1. Removed duplicate records
2. Handled missing or inconsistent values
3. Standardized column names and formats
4. Checked data accuracy

### 2. Data Organization
1. Structured the dataset properly
2. Categorized crime types and locations
3. Created summary tables

### 3. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
1. Used pivot tables to analyze crime trends
2. Identified high-crime areas
3. Analyzed crime frequency over time
4. Compared different crime categories

### 4. Data Visualization
1. Bar charts for crime type comparison
2. Line charts for time-based trends
3. Pie charts for proportion analysis
4. Clear and readable dashboards using Excel charts

## Key Insights
1. Identified areas with higher crime rates
2. Observed trends in crime occurrences over time
3. Compared different types of crimes
4. Highlighted safety patterns based on available data

## Project Files
1. `crime_safety_dataset.xlsx` – Contains cleaned data, analysis, pivot tables, and visualizations

## Conclusion
This project demonstrates how **Excel alone** can be effectively used for data analysis. It highlights strong fundamentals in data cleaning, analysis, and visualization without relying on programming tools.
